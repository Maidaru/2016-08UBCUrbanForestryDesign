      <head01>Our Vision</head>
      <img src="img/reading04.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt=""> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern society today, ecology awareness gradually plays a more and more important role around the world. We design the community to be a perfectly green and eco-friendly one. We would like to make our residence fit into the nature, instead of making a totally human-direction one. We want to make Eco-Home a sustainable society that People could enjoy the ecosystem service nearby, such as Pacific Spirit Regional Park, and, at the same time, experience the significance of the ecology. Our design aims to respect and protect nature, make people become a part of nature and ensure next generation could feel the throb and beauty of nature in the future.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach these goals, we have a few expectation about the community we would be happy to see in the future. Ecology is the point we emphasis on. We expect that people could become a part of nature. The place where residents relax and exercise is just the wildlife habitat and green corridor. People will feel easy to have wildlife and trees in their daily life. Moreover, we want to merge the Pacific Spirit Regional Park into the community culture. The central park could connect all the residents and the learning center could become a green study space not only for residents but for UBC faculties.

        <p>The runoffs from the green roofs are collected via the storm water pipes. They are pretreated to remove and solids and stored underground. The pump channels the water for irrigation and the overflow is drained into the ground. The pre treated water is also pumped to the storm water pond and the excess is stored in an underground aquifer. The aquifer pumps back the water to the pond during the dry months. In case of extreme flooding, the excess water will be channeled into a dry detention pond.  </p>

      At the first ground, most exquisite souvenirs attract people’s eyes, you can buy some flower seeds and books about Canadian trees. Most importantly, a large exhibition room stands at the centre at the first floor. We can see the overall layout of the forest and community clearly. </p>
      <p>Walk upstairs, you can see tons of books neatly on the shelf. They are all the books telling us trees’story. Then on the third floor, it is a good place for kids to recognize and study the nature. There is the other approach that citizens can easily enter the forest. </p>
      <p>Locating near the learning centre, a big tree  with board trail show us the natural beauty, people can enjoy the forest trip followed by tour guide as well as explore the forest by themselves. In addition, on the northern side, a jogging trail between two groves lead us to the forest. Individuals can breath clean air and enjoy running entertainment which are also benefit to their health. Therefore, on the basis of environmental protection, we strengthen interaction between people and nature. Encouraging them to be involved in forest activities is a good idea to enhance the bond.</p>

                  <p>Our ideal ecological connection map</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near our community site, there are several greenspaces. We have the more natural one (colored in dark green), the Pacific Spirit Park which surrounds our sites form left to right, and also more artificial ones (colored in light green), UBC Botanical Garden and Center for Plant Research, Rhododendron Wood, UBC Farm, Main Mall Greenway, Khorana Park, and Michael Smith Park. Our goals are connecting the neighboring greenspaces with the green infrastructures and greenspaces inside the site to exert maximum contributions of ecological services. Our site has three access towards the north to the Michael Park, towards the southwest to the Nobel Park and also UBC Farm, and towards the east side to the Pacific Spirit Park. Through these connections, animals and insects may have a more highly linked and integrated habitats, and they can transfer through the patches and more easily. All the greenspaces can combine to an integrated ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have sports Fields and Thunderbird Stadium in our neighborhood, so we save the spaces for the greenspaces and jogging trails. Even there are no big sports fields in our site, residences also have easy access to the neighboring recreational places. Furthermore, the community provides a good pathway for the neighbors to go into the Pacific Spirit Park. People in the community or in the neighbors can make use of the trials around the whole site to go straight to the forest without stopping.
Everyone can get their recreational benefits form the strong connection between the community and the neighborhood, for the ones who are eager to do exercise, they can finish sports and come to our community for jogging in the forest. For the ones who want to have family time with their children, and chances are, the children study in the elementary school, they can come down through Westbrook Mall to play in the open greenspaces and naturally designed playground. We also have learning center which can educate children about the nature in our community and neighbors. For people who is disabled or wanted a faster path towards the Pacific Spirit Park, we set up a boarder and well-paved pathway circles inside the site. This is convenient for wheelchairs and baby strollers. Through all the interactions and communications between people in and out our community, social connections are built up.
